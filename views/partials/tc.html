                <p><strong>The Leaving Gift’s Terms of Service</strong></p>

<p>These terms of service outline what The Leaving Gift Ltd does and how it operates. We run and maintain a website that provides a concierge service for collating, processing, choosing and delivering donations and messages on behalf of an initiator. This service charges a 10% fee for the administration and processing for the leaving gift and card. The 10% fee is taken from the total amount donated after the closing date on the registry page is passed. The remaining donation amount will be used to design, populate and deliver a card, and to choose and deliver a gift for the leaver.</p>

<p><strong>Returns</p></strong>

<p>The Leaving Gift Ltd acts on behalf of the initiator to purchase a card and gift for the leaver. Leaving gift cards will not be eligible for refund or exchange. The leaving gift will be eligible for refund or exchange as per the retailers’ terms and conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Insufficient funds collected</p></strong>

<p>Once registry closes, if the total donated amount is insufficient to buy the pre-specified gift, The Leaving Gift will either a) choose an appropriate similar gift of lesser value or b) use donations to purchase vouchers from a well-established internet retailer. If total donated amount exceeds the value of the gift specified, The Leaving Gift will either a) buy vouchers with the additional money or b) buy an upgraded version of the specified gift. The Leaving Gift will only operate its services when total donations on each gift registry page equal, or exceed, 5 GBP by the registry closing date; total donations less than 5 GBP will be returned to the donators.</p>
